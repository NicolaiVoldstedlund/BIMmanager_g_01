Claim to check: Access to evacuation routes 

## A2c

As manager, I integrate and analyze the results and claims from both analyst groups to evaluate how well the arrangement of desks ensures safe and compliant access to evacuation routes.

## A2d

The claim is justified by BR18, which requires that evacuation routes must be accessible, unobstructed, and dimensioned according to the number of occupants in the building. The placement of desks must not block or extend the access paths to evacuation routes beyond the permitted distances and capacities. This ensures that all occupants at their desks have quick and safe access to escape routes in case of fire or emergency.
