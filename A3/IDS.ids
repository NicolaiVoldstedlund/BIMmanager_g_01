IDS — Information Delivery Specification for the tool

PURPOSE
- Define the exact model content, properties and units required so the A3 script can run reliably and produce valid textual analyst outputs.

SCOPE
- IFC objects and properties used to count desks/occupants, measure door widths and map spaces to corridor/stair failure ids.

REQUIRED IFC ENTITIES & PROPERTIES
- IfcSpace
  - Required attributes: GlobalId, Name
  - Required property / quantity (one of):
    - Pset_SpaceOccupancy: OccupantCount (integer)
    - Pset_Space: DeskCount (integer)
    - OR desks represented as IfcFurnishingElement contained by the space (countable)
  - Optional helpful properties: grossFloorArea (m²), Height (m)
- IfcFurnishingElement / IfcFurniture (desks)
  - Must be classified or typed as a Desk/Workstation and connected to IfcSpace via IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure.
- IfcDoor
  - Required attributes: GlobalId, Name
  - Required property: clear opening width (Length) — prefer Pset_DoorCommon:OverallWidth or explicit OpeningWidth (unit: m)
  - Doors should reference the IfcSpace they serve (containment/connection).
- IfcStair / IfcStairFlight / corridor indicator
  - Must be identifiable by type/classification or name so analysis can map failing element IDs to spaces.

UNITS & TYPES
- Length/width units in IFC: metres (m). Script converts to cm for reporting.
- Area units: square metres (m²).
- Counts: integers >= 0.

EXPORT / TEXT DERIVATION REQUIREMENTS (for the analyst TXT inputs your script consumes)
- If using intermediary text export, ensure the following lines are present per space:
  - "Space : <Title or id>"
  - "No. of desks in this space: <int>"
  - "No. of doors: <int>" (if available)
  - "Total door width: <numeric> cm|mm|m" (units explicit)
  - "Desk to door width ratio: <numeric> cm" (optional)
- analysis_summary must contain failing element IDs under headings "Corridors" and/or "Stair flights" in quoted lists or inline lists:
  - e.g.: Corridors ... Failing element ID's "12345 12346"

VALIDATION RULES (minimum checks before running the script)
- IfcSpace must provide an occupant/desk count OR contain desks that can be counted.
- IfcDoor must provide a numeric width (or be flagged as "width not reported").
- Units must be consistent (lengths in m); exported TXT must annotate units when not in cm.
- All counts and numeric values must be non-negative and numeric parseable.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA / LOIN (level of information need)
- Each space has an occupant count or desks that map to occupant count.
- Every door relevant to evacuation routes has a clear opening width property.
- Spaces and circulation elements (corridor/stair) have identifiers or numeric tokens that can be matched to analysis_summary failing IDs.
- If any required values are missing, they must be flagged in the export (script will treat missing widths as "width not reported" and may mark UNKNOWN / PASS/FAIL accordingly).

REMARKS
- Keep property names, classifications and units stable across exports or provide a mapping.  
- This IDS is intended as a minimal contract to ensure the A3 script can run reliably and produce valid text/JSON report and optional chart output.
