# A5 - REFLECTION

## My learning experience:
- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:

I would say that my level from the start was "modeler" as I had previously taken the OpenBIM course where we had to model a building. I started out as a mix of modeler and analyst as I also had some experience with Python and the possibility of analyzing things through scripts. I took on the role of manager together with my (at the time) group. Both my group members dropped out after the 2nd lesson. I considered giving up the responsibility as OpenBIM manager but thought it would be good development for me, both to analyze and simultaneously be manager for the other groups and gather their knowledge and elevate scripts based on their analyses. I therefore feel that I ended my journey on this course as a relatively confident OpenBIM manager.

- What else do you still need to learn?

I still need to learn more about the mechanisms in OpenBIM through IFC files and how BlenderBIM/Bonsai works 100% to feel completely confident within the subject. I also need to dive deeper into how Python operates through ifcopenshell to understand the root of the information being extracted from the model/IFC file. I would love to learn more about how to implement coding and automation of workflows in e.g., Revit (even though I know that Autodesk is not well-regarded in this course :D)

- how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

I would really like to use OpenBIM at my workplace as a building designer to automate some processes that normally take a long time to complete. This applies to both modeling but also documentation of projects that could be automated and made smarter through OpenBIM. I would also like to introduce the use of open file formats like IFC instead of Revit at my workplace so everyone could have access to the building model and extract information about it without necessarily having access to Revit or similar software.

## Your process of developing the tutorial
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

I am currently writing my diploma project and will not be using the content from this course as I am writing my project concurrently with this course. But for later projects, the same process could be implemented if the opportunity and necessity arise.

- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

No. I liked that it was an open field where you could use your own knowledge to find a case that would be relevant to yourself. This way, everything becomes more individualized and nuanced than if the possibilities were more limited.

- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

I think the number of tools was very appropriate as there were many different disciplines that could embrace these in their own way.

- Note

I did not develop a tutorial for my script but rather a tutorial for something I thought was relevant for everyone taking on the role as OpenBIM manager and possibly also for OpenBIM analysts -> see assignment A4

## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
- did the tool address the use case you identified?

### Script feedback

My script did almost what I wanted it to but failed to connect the two analyst scripts 100% together. Since the results from the two scripts differentiated from each other, it was difficult to find direct connections between the two. I was therefore forced to assume that the rooms that had a door from one script had access to the corridor that the other group had identified. Requirements for building regulations were complied with and analyzed as expected. General feedback on our scripts from the architects was:

- Generally, we work mostly with geometry and the connections between geometries are difficult to find as they are not specified anywhere when creating the model
- Doors are a general problem as we don't know if it's an internal wall to a toilet or to a corridor, which was the goal to figure out.
- The tools became very specific and not as universal as they are based on names and not types which are global and not just individual for each model you work with.
- I couldn't consolidate data between the two scripts as their common connection (the door) was not defined the same way in each script. To solve this, it needs to be built up in the same way to be able to identify when a door belongs to a room with desks and leads out to the escape route.

### Tutorial feedback

My presentation consisted of a presentation of my tutorial on GitHub for managers and possibly also helpful for analysts. I received no questions but got good recognition with a show of hands that it could have been helpful for many of my fellow students, which was the ultimate goal of the tutorial.

- What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).

As described in assignment A3, my tool can be used in both design phase C and D depending on how you want to implement it. "This tool is particularly useful in **Stage C** of the Advanced Building Design process, where the arrangement of spaces and furniture is finalized. It could also be helpful in **Stage D**, where details and optimization are applied to the design process to ensure that desk locations comply with accessibility requirements." quote from A3

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

Since I am writing my diploma project concurrently with the course, I have not had the opportunity to implement it. If I one day choose to pursue a master's degree and have to write a master's thesis, I would like to implement some of the tools I have learned in this course.

- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

Yes, if the means and openness for using OpenBIM at my future workplace are there, I would really like to try to get it implemented.

## (Individual) Wrap up
- conclude the journey through A1-A5

A1 - Previous experience as OpenBIM modeler and analyst but not manager. Successful work with analysis myself and the role as manager to gather various analyses from the architect groups
A2 - New experience with creating BPMN diagrams which gave a good understanding of how to present and show how a script actually works, what you can use it for, which inputs and outputs you get from it.
A3 - Limitations at the start of the tool because I was dependent on the other groups' scripts to be able to create a master script that summarized all information and found the connection in accessibility from desk to the escape route in the building. In the meantime, I worked on my tutorial for A4 which had nothing to do with my script. The script was completed and challenged me greatly, but the result was close to the desired result defined in A2.
A4 - Throughout the entire course, I have had many challenges with GitHub and the workflow as manager to keep track that all scripts work as they should and that I had access to the right things from the analysts. Therefore, I chose to make a tutorial about GitHub and the workflow between Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I would have benefited greatly from this tutorial myself and therefore it seemed obvious that this should be my tutorial as I hoped it could help others in the future.
A5 - This final assignment has given me a good insight into my entire journey through the course and has made me wiser about myself and where I should have placed more focus than other places. I think the different assignments have connected well together, and that I have managed to maintain a good thread through my assignments that form the basis for my learning through the course and what I have managed to achieve.
